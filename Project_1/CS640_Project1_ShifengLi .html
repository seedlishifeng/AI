<h2> Problem Definition </h2>
<p>
<col>
<li> In this Project Assignment, we need to deal with several problems about Neural Network. First, we need to finish Linear Regression using 2-Layer NN on the Linear data set. </li>
<li> Then, we should try the same algorithm on non-Linear data set and see the result about the algorithm. </li>
<li> After that, we need to finish the algorithm using Logistic Regression with 3-Layer NN on both Linear data set and non-Linear data set and show the decision boundaries of both data sets. </li>
<li> Then, we will learn how Learning Rate effects the results in Logistic Regression by trying different Learning Rates on our data sets and get the results. </li>
<li> After Learning Rate, we should see how the number of hidden layers effect the results. </li>
<li> What's more, we also need to do learn the effects about overfitting and the ways to deal with that problem. Finally, we shall finish the L2 Regulation algorithm and see how it deal with the problem of overfitting. </li>

<h4><li> What is overfitting and why does it occur in practice? Name and
  briefly explain 3 ways to reduce overfitting. </h4>	
  <td>
  Overfitting, which is caused by a hypothesis function that fits the available data but does not generalize well to predict new data.
  It is usually caused by adding too many features and producing a complicated function that creates a lot of unnecessary curves and angles unrelated to the data.
	<p>
	<col>
	<h4> i. Cross-validation </h4>
	<td>
	The idea is using the initial training data to generate multiple mini train-test splits. Then use these splits to tune the model.
	</td>
	<h4> ii. Increasing the number of training data </h4>
	<td>
	The idea is increasing the amount of training data. It won’t work everytime, but training with more data can help algorithms detect the signal better and improve the result.
	</td>	
	<h4> iii. L2 Regularization </h4>
	<td>
	The idea is increasing the squared sum of all weights into the cost function so that we can avoid too many features, which always lead to overfitting.
	</td>
	</col>
	</p>
	
</li>
	
<h4> <li> One common technique used to reduce overfitting is L2
  regularization. How does L2 regularization prevent overfitting? Implement
  L2 regularization. How differently does your model perform before and
  after implementing L2 regularization?

<h2> Discussion </h2>

<ul>
<h4><li>Strength and Weakness:</li></h4>
<tr>
  <td>
  <h4>Strength: </h4>In this project, we have done pretty good with the Linear data and Non-Linear data. We can detect the decision boundaries well and get pretty high accuracies. 
  We also learn a lot about the theories about how Neural Network works with Linear Regression and Logistic Regression. 
  </td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>
  <h4>Weakness: </h4>In this project, we don't have some overfitting data so we don't know whether our algorithms can deal with overfitting problems perfectly. Moreover, we haven't 
  implemented the Neural Network with more than one hidden layers so that the results cannot be regarded as very precise. Finally, we still have some questions about how the hidden layer 
  influence the accuracies and some situations like the descent in accuracy when dealing with the Non-Linear data with the number of hidden nodes in the range of 120 to 160. 
  </td>
</tr>
<td>
</td>
<h4><li>Successful or Limited and expected result: </li></h4>
<tr>
  Overall saying, I think our project and results are really successful because we get pretty good decision boundaries and accuracies. We also learn how the learning rate and the number of hidden nodes 
  infulence the results and how to choose proper learning rate and hidden nodes number. The results also perform well like what we expected before starting this project. However, there's one limitation that 
  we don't have some data with overfitting problem so that we don't know whether our algorithms can deal with the overfitting problems perfectly. 
 </tr>
<h4><li>Potential future work:</li> </h4>
<tr>
  First of all, we shall improve our algorithm and try more data sets to get better more accurate results. What's more, we want to find some data sets with the overfitting problems to test our algorithm 
  on this aspect and make some improvements if needed. Finally, we also want to try some more complicated Neural Networks with more hidden layers and nodes. 
</tr>  
</ul>
<p></p>

<hr>
<h2> Conclusions </h2>

<p>
<tr>
  We get pretty good decision boundaries and accuracies and learn a lot about how Neural Network works and the algorithms it uses. We also find that we must use multi-layer Neural Network to deal with 
  Non-Linear data for high accuracies and results. Moreover, we learn how some other factors like learning rate and number of nodes influence the result of Neural Network. 
  We also get the orientation of improving our project and algorithms.
